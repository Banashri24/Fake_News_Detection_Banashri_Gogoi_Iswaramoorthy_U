## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
The analysis revealed that true news articles often used formal language,
focused on factual reporting, and frequently mentioned established news sources,
locations, and individuals.
Fake News: In contrast, fake news articles tended to employ sensationalized language,
emotional appeals, and often lacked verifiable sources or evidence. They also showed a
higher frequency of subjective opinions and misleading claims.

The objective of this assignment is to develop a Semantic Classification mode

For this assignment, you will work with two datasets, True.csv and Fake.csv. Both datasets contain three columns:

a)title of the news article
b)text of the news article
c)date of article publication


## Conclusions
In essence, the code represents a promising approach to combating fake news. By leveraging the power of semantic analysis and machine learning, it provides a tool to identify potentially misleading information and safeguard the integrity of news sources.
